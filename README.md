🖼️ Cartoonify Image using OpenCV

Turn real-life photos into cartoon-style images using computer vision techniques with OpenCV and NumPy!

📌 Project Description

This project takes a real image and transforms it into a cartoon-like image by applying a series of image processing techniques. It uses grayscale conversion, median blur, edge detection, and bilateral filtering to create a smooth, colorful cartoon effect.

🚀 Features
Load and display images

Resize images for consistent processing

Convert to grayscale

Apply median blur for noise reduction

Detect edges using adaptive thresholding

Apply bilateral filter for smoothening

Combine edges and color for final cartoon effect
